      Stress is a normal reaction the body has when changes occur. It can respond to these changes physically, mentally, or emotionally.Stress can be a positive thing, as it triggers our flight or fight response. However, stress can also be a very negative thing when the stress response is elongated. Stress causes both emotional and physical effects on the body. Some of the physical effects include headaches, an upset stomach, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, and problems sleeping. These physical symptoms cause wear and tear on the body. The emotional symptoms of stress include depression, panic attacks, and other forms of anxiety.

        While stress is not actually a mental health disorder, stress is something that many teens deal with on a daily basis. While some students may strive under stress, stress can actually cause more mental health issues in the future. Learning to combat stress and overcome stressful times without harming oneâ€™s health is something that all teens need to be able to learn. For teens, stress can come from many places. In a study done by Becky Beacom, health education manager for PAMF, where she surveyed 124 students, 55% responded that school is the main reason for their stress. Next came family at 15%, 9% said social life, 8% said having no time, sports were said to be 4%, and 9% of the responses were categorized as other.
