      According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, in any given year, 1 in 5 people in Canada will personally experience a mental health problem or illness. It is also estimated that 10-20% of Canadian youth are affected by a mental illness or disorder, which makes youth the most disabling group of disorders worldwide. In order to help more people, we need to inform the public about Mental Health. It is estimated that once depression has been recognized, help, whether that be from friends, family, or from professionals, can make a difference for 80% of people who are affected. In Canada alone, only 1 out of 5 children who need mental health services receives them. This is in part due to the fact that many donâ€™t understand enough about mental illnesses to be able to see the symptoms for them. If we can educate the public, than hopefully more people will be able to recognize the symptoms of common mental illnesses, the same way we recognize symptoms for stuff like colds, in order to help get others the medical attention they need.
