    <h6 class="subheading"> What is Suicide </h6>
    <p class="spacing">
      Many people don’t like to talk about suicide, and just hope it never happens to anyone they know, but suicide is a big reality that we must face and is much more common than many people even think. The people who are most at risk of having suicidal thoughts include people who are experiencing major changes/losses in their lives like the loss of a loved one, unemployment, or divorce serious, those with mental or physical illnesses, are abusing alcohol/drugs, and those who have made previous suicide threats. In lots of cases, those who talk about their suicidal thoughts or even those that make an attempt, don’t necessarily want to actually die, and rather are using it as a means of crying out for help. A suicide attempt can sometimes be the turning point for an individual if afterwards, they receive lots of support to help them make the necessary changes to their life. People usually show warning signs and clues, as suicide is rarely an impromptu decision.
